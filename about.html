          <h3>Bio</h3>
          <p>
            Hello! I am Sogelola Ayanfeoluwa, I am a versatile and
            detail-oriented front-end web developer with a Bachelor's degree in
            Civil Engineering, offering a unique combination of analytical
            precision and creative problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not coding, you can find me on the nearest basketball
            court, or in your Call of Duty lobby. I believe in a balanced
            enviroment where "Jack" gets to work and relax at the same time.

          <h3>Note to Future Self</h3>
          <p>Dear Future Me,</p>
          <p>
            Wagwan? Do you remember when you started this journey? maybe you
            don't. Let me remind you, you were excited and a little nervous and
            somewhat overwhelmed, but determined to grow. I hope by the time you
            are reading this, you have conquered some of those feelings and
            things are easier for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not forget to live in the moment, celebrate your wins, no matter
            how small they might seem. Every bug fixed, every feature completed,
            every concept understood is a step forward. Keep building! keep
            building!
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly, remember that it is okay to struggle. The best
            developers are not those who never face problems, but those who
            persist through them.
          </p>

          <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            This HNG program is bigger than just learning to code better. It is
            about becoming part of a community, understanding how to build
            products that matter, and developing the mindset of a professional
            Software Engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am excited about this journey ahead and I'm looking forward to
            seeing how much I will grow throughout this experience.
